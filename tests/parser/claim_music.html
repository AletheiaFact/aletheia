<p>But I said, \"No, no, no\"</p>\n
<p>Yes, I've been black</p>\n
<p>But when I come back, you'll know, know, know</p>\n
<p>I ain't got the time</p>\n
<p>And if my daddy thinks I'm fine</p>\n
<p>He's tried to make me go to rehab</p>\n
<p>I won't go, go, go</p>\n
<p>I'd rather be at home with Ray</p>\n
<p>I ain't got seventy days</p>\n
<p>'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me</p>\n
<p>That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway</p>\n
<p>I didn't get a lot in class</p>\n
<p>But I know it don't come in a shot glass</p>\n
<p>They tried to make me go to rehab</p>\n

<p>The man said, \"Why do you think you here?\"</p>\n
<p>I said, \"I got no idea\"</p>\n
<p>I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby</p>\n
<p>So I always keep a bottle near</p>\n
<p>He said, \"I just think you're depressed\"</p>\n
<p>This me, \"Yeah, baby, and the rest\"</p>\n

<p>And it's not just my pride</p>\n
<p>It's just 'til these tears have dried</p>\n
<p>They tried to make me go to rehab</p>\n
