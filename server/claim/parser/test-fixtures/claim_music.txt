They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said, \"No, no, no\"
Yes, I've been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go
I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
'Cause there's nothing, there's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr. Hathaway
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass
They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said, \"No, no, no\"
Yes, I've been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go
The man said, \"Why do you think you here?\"
I said, \"I got no idea\"
I'm gonna, I'm gonna lose my baby
So I always keep a bottle near
He said, \"I just think you're depressed\"
This me, \"Yeah, baby, and the rest\"
They tried to make me go to rehab
But I said, \"No, no, no\"
Yes, I've been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I don't ever wanna drink again
I just, oh, I just need a friend
I'm not gonna spend ten weeks
Have everyone think I'm on the mend
And it's not just my pride
It's just 'til these tears have dried
They tried to make me go to rehab
I said, \"No, no, no\"
Yes, I've been black
But when I come back, you'll know, know, know
I ain't got the time
And if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab
I won't go, go, go
