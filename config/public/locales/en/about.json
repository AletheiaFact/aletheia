    "firstParagraph":  "The AlumiaLab.org organization is a technology and <0>product development-focused startup</0> that began to be thought of in 2019, from experimentation, during the <1>Mozilla Open Lab</1> program. In this program, we developed a prototype with the necessary infrastructure to build a scalable, high-performance platform that, using structured data, could store and classify statements and analyses of statements made by socially relevant personalities in official speeches. In the genesis process of AlumiaLab.org, user surveys were conducted in order to understand what the product would become, always prioritizing the contextual aspects related to solving the problems caused by misinformation in Brazil.",
